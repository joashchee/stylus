# Builds a release Stylus.app (and DMG) that runs on any Mac someone
# downloads it to: universal (Apple Silicon and Intel), signed with the
# maintainer's Developer ID and the hardened runtime, notarized by Apple
# and stapled, then zipped for the release. Without the build machine's
# paths in it: rustc bakes source file paths into panic messages,
# including those of every dependency under ~/.cargo/registry, which would
# publish the builder's home folder (and user name). --remap-path-prefix
# rewrites them. When several prefixes match, rustc applies the last one,
# so the more specific project path comes after $HOME.
#
# Arguments are passed on to `tauri build`, e.g. `--bundles app`.
# Afterwards the built app is searched for $HOME, and the script fails if
# it's still there. Always build releases with this script. Finally the
# built Stylus.app is copied to ~/Applications (see the end).
#
# Signing and notarization need, once:
#   1. A "Developer ID Application" certificate in the login keychain
#      (Xcode > Settings > Accounts > Manage Certificates > +, or the
#      developer site). Found by itself; with more than one, name it in
#      APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY.
#   2. notarytool's credentials in the keychain, under a profile:
#        xcrun notarytool store-credentials stylus \
#          --apple-id you@example.com --team-id TEAMID
#      (it asks for an app-specific password from account.apple.com).
#      Another profile name: STYLUS_NOTARY_PROFILE.
# STYLUS_UNSIGNED=1 builds without them (signed ad hoc, not notarized):
# for trying the build only, never for a release, as Gatekeeper blocks it
# on any other Mac.
