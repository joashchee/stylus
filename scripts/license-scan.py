"""License scan for Stylus's dependencies. Run it whenever Cargo.lock or
package-lock.json changes (CLAUDE.md rule 2).

Stylus is MIT and takes no GPL/AGPL/LGPL dependencies, so that
stylus-core stays usable by the closed-source ansiapps apps. This lists
every license in the Rust tree (src-tauri, which includes stylus-core) and
the npm production tree, and fails on anything copyleft-only, missing, or
not yet reviewed. A license that offers a permissive choice ("MIT OR
LGPL-2.1") passes: we take the permissive option.

REVIEWED holds crates checked by hand, with why they're allowed. Add to it
only after reading the crate's actual license.

Usage: scripts/license-scan.py   (needs the crates fetched: cargo fetch)
